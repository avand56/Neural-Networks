# Neural-Networks
Contains colvolutional and artificial neural networks (CNN and ANN, respectively) created for research, coursework, and practice.
Some of these will be a work in progress or were build as demonstrations for the research group and contain mainly commentary. These include:

1) A CNN and an ANN to predict housing prices from mixed image and dataframe data.

2) A multi-task CNN to predict digits and colours from an image input.

3) A markdown file to explain semantic image segmentation convolutional neural networks to the research group.
